/**
 * Annotation used for logically grouping fields within a class. It is especially useful in classes
 * where precise control over the memory layout of fields is required, or in scenarios where
 * logically grouping related fields can simplify code that operates on these fields.
 *
 * <p>The {@link FieldGroup} annotation is retained at runtime and can be used to annotate
 * fields within a class. The name of the group is specified through the 'value' method,
 * allowing multiple fields to be associated with the same group by assigning them the same name.</p>
 *
 * <p>One common use case is organizing the memory layout for serialization or memory-mapped
 * objects where fields that are accessed together are placed adjacently in memory.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * public class Record {
 *     &#64;FieldGroup("header")
 *     private int headerField1;
 *
 *     &#64;FieldGroup("header")
 *     private int headerField2;
 *
 *     &#64;FieldGroup("body")
 *     private int bodyField1, bodyField2;
 * }
 * </pre>
