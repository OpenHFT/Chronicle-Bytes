/**
 * StreamingDataOutput is an interface for classes that support writing data to a stream.
 * Position based access.  Once data has been read, the writePosition() moves.
 *
 * <p>The various write methods in this interface support writing bytes, arrays of bytes, and sequences
 * of bytes from other sources like {@link ByteBuffer} and {@link RandomDataInput}. It also provides
 * methods for writing primitive data types and their boxed counterparts. Additionally, it supports
 * writing complex data structures such as {@link BigDecimal}, {@link BigInteger}, {@link Histogram}
 * and objects in unsafe way.
 *
 * <p>Not all the methods are expected to be implemented by classes. Default methods are provided for
 * common use cases. Classes that extend this interface can override these methods to provide more
 * efficient or custom implementations.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are expected to handle cases where the buffer may not have
 * enough capacity to handle the write operation. In such cases, methods should throw a {@link BufferOverflowException}.
 *
 * <p>Instances of classes implementing StreamingDataOutput are not guaranteed to be thread safe. If multiple
 * threads interact with the same instance, external synchronization should be used.
